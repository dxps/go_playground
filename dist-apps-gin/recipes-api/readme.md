## OpenAPI

The OpenAPI (Swagger) spec is generated with [go-swagger](https://goswagger.io/) tool using `go-swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json`

And you can also play with a local UI using `go-swagger serve ./swagger.json` or `go-swagger serve -F swagger ./swagger.json` to get a ReDoc based UI or Swagger UI, respectively.
