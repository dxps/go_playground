This is an example of implementing a file upload:

-   on the front-end side using a `go-app` based implementation
-   on the back-end side using a standard implementation

## Usage

-   Run `./run_svc.sh` to start the service.
-   If doing development (especially when using TailwindCSS related CSS rules), run `./run_css.sh` as well.

Go to http://localhost:9001 and play with it.
